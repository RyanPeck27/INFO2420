Project7 folder created for 'Rent-A-Pet'.

Files generated:
- Home.html
- mystyles.css
- myscripts.js

Images are expected under Project7/Images/
(you provided a Graphics.html earlier which referenced images; make sure the following images exist in Images/)
Suggested images:
- banner6.jpg
- blaqqcat.jpg
- rentapet.png
- HamsterLg.jpg, HamsterSm.jpg
- Horse1Lg.jpg, Horse1Sm.jpg
- HuntingDogsLg.jpg, HuntingDogsSm.jpg

- Thumb folders / images as needed

If you'd like I can:
- replace the placeholder welcome paragraph with exact contents of PetsWelcome.txt (if you upload it),
- assemble a zip of the entire Project7 folder,
- or adjust colors and layout.
