    <h2>Utah National Parks – <a href="http://www.utah.com/nationalparks/" target="_blank">http://www.utah.com/nationalparks/</a></h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>First Impression:</strong> The site has a clean and professional look. The imagery is stunning and immediately makes you want to explore Utah’s parks.</li>
        <li><strong>Information Flow:</strong> The layout uses a top navigation bar with dropdown menus, along with visual links in the main content area. There's a clear focus on helping users find information quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> The structure is logical. It’s divided by park names and travel categories (things to do, places to stay, maps, etc.). It’s very intuitive for users planning trips.</li>
        <li><strong>Graphics/Layout:</strong> High-quality photos and a well-balanced layout greatly enhance the site. The imagery adds value and effectively showcases the beauty of Utah’s parks.</li>
        <li><strong>Load Time:</strong> The homepage loaded in about 3 seconds. Considering the large images, that’s a reasonable load time.</li>
        <li><strong>Text Readability:</strong> The text is clear and easy to read. Font size and contrast are appropriate. Background colors are subtle and do not interfere with readability.</li>
        <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> The site uses both a top navigation bar and in-page links. It’s easy to move between sections and find what you’re looking for. Navigation is very well done.</li>
        <li><strong>Look and Feel Consistency:</strong> Yes, the visual style and layout remain consistent across all pages. The design reinforces the site's theme of natural exploration and travel.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The site adjusts nicely to smaller screen sizes. Navigation collapses into a mobile-friendly menu, and content stacks vertically. It's well-optimized for mobile use.</li>
        <li><strong>Unusual or Well Done:</strong> The interactive maps and itinerary suggestions are particularly helpful and well-executed. It also integrates well with other travel planning tools and local recommendations.</li>
